# Classifying and ranking text using NLTK and The Nameless Horror

This is a small demo showing basic NLTK functionality (tokenizing, classifying, frequency counting), using [The Collected Works of H.P. Lovecraft](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0600031h.html) as a corpus.
The code ought to be fairly self-explanatory.
The script will write a file, `results.pickle`, to your current working directory upon its first run, because classification is quite slow. This allows you to tune the [tag set](lhttp://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html) to be used for frequency counting without having to wait for re-classification each time. The script is designed to be run interactively from e.g. an IPython (using `--pylab` to allow figure generation) instance, hence the final comment regarding resizing. If you wish to save the resulting graph, use `plt.savefig(filename, **kwargs)`.

## Requirements

- Requests
- BeautifulSoup4
- NLTK
- Matplotlib 1.4.x

You may have to install Matplotlib from Github, as 1.4 has not been released as of late July 2013, and you'll need it (and Humor Sans) for the [XKCD-style graphs](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/07/10/XKCD-plots-in-matplotlib/).
